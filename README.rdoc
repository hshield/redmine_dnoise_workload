= Description
This plugin uses graphics to represent total workloads and also the workload involved in the following tasks:
* Average time assigned to issues. The plugin shows the amount of hours per issues within a project
as well as the total of hours assigned to that project. Different colours are assigned to each issue.
* This application also represents the % of hours used against the % of hours estimated for a issue. It
also indicates the amount of extra time used over the initial estimate. In addition to this, the plugin
also advise if a project doesnâ€™t have assigned and also beginning and end dates.
* This plug-in determines the timing of an application, showing different status: on time, delayed, etc
* This plugin is especially helpful in organisations with a high workload and/or an organisation with
scarce human resources
